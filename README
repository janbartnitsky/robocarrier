maps folder contains maps used in the contest tests. file name is a map dimension. map 1000 is used in tests 6 to 10.

tests.csv contains data for tests creation. for each test we have to set up random orders generator:
Order is set of 4 random numbers from 1 to map dimension.
At each iteration orders_count / iterations_count orders must be generated
